# Rewards-Test
Aviyel Rewards lets open source communities reward their contributors using badges that can be minted as non-transferable NFTs, swag and much more. Contributors can now showcase their contributions, build reputation and inspire others.


Reputation as an incentive : Open Source Communities

Open source projects are the lego blocks of the tech ecosystem and the key to explosive adoption of a project is its community. Community is the heart of any project and we at Aviyel are building a platform for amazing communities to be more active and awesome. You should definitely check us out if you are the maintainer, contributor or fan of an open source project.

Reputation. Motivation : Aviyel Rewards
Open source contributions are invaluable; they are driven by passion, interest and the urge to solve problems. However, we believe it would be great if the contributors could showcase their work, wear it as a badge of honour and inspire others.
Aviyel hosts some of the most popular and widely adopted open source projects that are launching their own reward program on Aviyel for their respective communities. The projects that we onboarded have been very particular ( so are we ), that it should not be just the code contributions that should be included in this program. Aviyel rewards is designed and being built to work for code contribution, bug reports, contributions on discord, slack, content, evangelisation and much more.

How does this work?
The setup is simple - its literally a couple of clicks. We want the experience to be as seamless as it is exciting.
Here is a step by step intro to how this works.
 1. Select the activities and contributions that you would like to include in the program. You can always add more activities later. From our end, we are also adding more activities and details every other week. (add image )
 2. Points can be configured against each activity. Obviously, each activity and contribution would have a different impact and need a different score. Also, did you notice we are calling our points as seeds. We think these rewards are the seeds that is going to grow into fruiting trees in the ecosystem. However, each project can have a different kind of seed that best resonates with their ideology, brand or vision. ( add image ).
 3. Seeds unlock levels, and each level would have a badge associated with it. We are building a library of themes that the project can choose from, and are working with a bunch of amazing design contributors from across the world to make sure this theme library is awesome and the badges are kickass.
