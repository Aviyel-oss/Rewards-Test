# Rewards-Test
Aviyel Rewards lets open source communities reward their contributors using badges that can be minted as non-transferable NFTs, swag and much more. Contributors can now showcase their contributions, build reputation and inspire others.


#Reputation as an incentive : Open Source Communities

Open source projects are the lego blocks of the tech ecosystem and the key to explosive adoption of a project is its community. Community is the heart of any project and we at Aviyel are building a platform for amazing communities to be more active and awesome. You should definitely check us out if you are the maintainer, contributor or fan of an open source project.

Reputation. Motivation : Aviyel Rewards
Open source contributions are invaluable; they are driven by passion, interest and the urge to solve problems. However, we believe it would be great if the contributors could showcase their work, wear it as a badge of honour and inspire others.
Aviyel hosts some of the most popular and widely adopted open source projects that are launching their own reward program on Aviyel for their respective communities. The projects that we onboarded have been very particular ( so are we ), that it should not be just the code contributions that should be included in this program. Aviyel rewards is designed and being built to work for code contribution, bug reports, contributions on discord, slack, content, evangelisation and much more.
